# Guided Research Project 
 
Research Topic: Federated Machine Learning Implementation on Image Classification.

## Description:
This project aims to explore federated learning for image classification while preserving privacy. The goal is to develop a federated learning algorithm specifically designed for image classification tasks and evaluate its performance compared to centralized training approaches. The project incorporates privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy and secure aggregation, to ensure the protection of sensitive data during the learning process.


## Project Structure
This repository contains the code and resources for implementing federated machine learning for image classification. The project aims to explore the application of federated learning algorithms on image classification tasks. The implementation focuses on privacy-preserving techniques and efficient communication protocols.
