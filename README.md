# Guided Research Project 
 
Research Topic: Federated Machine Learning Implementation on Image Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing federated machine learning for image classification. The project aims to explore the application of federated learning algorithms using the TensorFlow Federated (TFF) framework on image classification tasks. The implementation focuses on privacy-preserving techniques and efficient communication protocols provided by TFF.
